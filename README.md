# Project: Recursion

This is a project from [TheOdinProject's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) where I implement the __Merge Sort__ algorithm in __JavaScript__.

## Algorithm

```javascript
// Sort the left half of the array
// Sort the rigth half of the array
// Merge both arrays
```

## ðŸ›  Tools & technologies
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) & [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/).
- [NPM](https://npmjs.com).
- JavaScript Debug Terminal.

## ðŸš€ Demo

To try a demo, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://npmjs.com) installed.

### Steps

- Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
- Go to the repository directory in your terminal and enter the following commands:
```bash
# Install and run nodemon to see live changes.
# This is not required, but if you skip it, you may need to run 'node index.js' each time you make a change.

npm install
...

# Run nodemon with npm
npm run watch
...
```
- Open the `index.js` file and edit the array, save and view the sorted array in the terminal.
